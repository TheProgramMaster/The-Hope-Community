# The-Hope-Community
  This is a blog with chat and video-chat capabilities designed to give cancer care patients a place to communicate with one another. We also publish articles debunking myths surrounding palliative treatment, and provide ESAS test. We have the capacity to publish recent medical articles surrounding cancer illnesses, as well.
